# Orientation Estimation
The main file to run the program is orientationEstimation

To test generation of the rotations:
* Put the filename into the orientationEstimation file. Make sure that the format of the IMU data is the
format that was shown in the handout (i.e., Ax, Ay, Az, Wz, Wx, and Wy). Then to run, simply press run orientationEstimation.

The orientationEstimation will bring up the diagram of the difference between the expected and the actual Euler Angles.
Of course since I'm using Method 2 (using only quaternion as the state vector) and so the Yaw estimation doesn't work well.

Then, this same function will use my estimations of the rotation matricies in order to generate the panorama.

If you want to use the vicon data to create the panorama, simply run the plotVicon directly.
